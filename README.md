## About
SongsToDieTo is a client-side death music mod made for Project Zomboid, which aims to:
  - Give users the ability to change aspects of the songs being played, such as:
      - Volume. X
      - The Order in which the songs are played. âˆš
      - More WIP features.
  - Will eventually act as a framework, allowing people to post songs to the Steam
    Workshop that utilize this mod's features.
    
I initially made this mod out of frustration with not being able to properly configure
the "death music" mods currently available on Steam Workshop.

## WARNING
This mod is largely a 'Work In Progress' project of mine, and as such some aspects of 
the code and its function may be incomplete or otherwise unoptimized.

## Versioning
As of now, I currently have no plans to backport this to any previous builds of the game,
as a decent portion of Lua event hooking has changed between the versions.

## Note
I am an amateur coder at best, so with that being said, any help in achieving the goals
of this mod or otherwise cleaning up what is here is greatly appreciated.
